This city is a place where rainfall is experienced for an average of eighteen days per month and also having high levels of humidity it makes it a perfect place to study car accident severity due to the weather. \nSeattle had set a goal that for 2030 they'll have 0% of fatal or serious injuries for car accidents. Although this numbers have decreased through the years it seems very unlikely that the city will reach this goal for 2030. So the purpose of this project y to predict the severity of this accidents due to several variables so that the city can take action.\n"

This columns contains a vast amount of variables such as location, vehicle count, road condition and lightning condition, weather, collision type and many others. \nWith this information i'll train the dataset to predict the accident severity due to most of this variables but most of it focused on the weather and road conditions. I'll need to separate this data set to a train dataset and a test dataset to have the best results possible."
